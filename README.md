# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Working
1. App.tsx contains 2 component search and weather detail component.
2. Search component consists of an input element which will call for an API when a user will enter some value, the API call is on debounce functionality.
3. The responses are shown as a dropdown list component named as (SearchDropdown) below the input bar only, upon clicking on any of the city available in the dropdown list the weather details API is called for the same city and weather details is fetched for the same city.
4. The API's used are third party API's as no open API's are provided from your side, I'm not sure will it work on every system. As I'm using my account only for API calling.
5. Weather details component ask for a city i.e which city detail do you need to show, then it calls for an API to get that city data.
6. City weather information is shown.
7. clear button is added to clear the search bar search query.
